    	  <h1>What is World Builder?</h1>
	      <p>We are a fledgling blockhcain and crypto think tank and incubator. Our white paper is available, but it's in draft form. It should be completed shortly. In the meantime, if you want to support this project, you can join us in <a href = "https://t.me/tworldbuilder">our Telegram group</a>, or use our affiliate links listed below.</p>
	      <p><b>Core Mission</b>: While there will be a number of projects, our core objective is to promote greater feedom and prosperity, around the world (and maybe beyond?), through blockchain and cryptoasset technologies.</p>

	    <div class="col-md-12 rounded border">
	      <h1>Our Token</h1>
	      <p>Our TRC-10 token, which will act as the economic core to bootstrap the various projects that we develop, is already live and is available for purchase through <a href = "https://tronscan.org/#/token/1002567">TronScan</a>. The sale will continue through the end of the year. However, we're <a href = "https://www.publish0x.com/the-bcu-times/gamifying-icos-moving-beyond-traditional-icos-improve-health-xppvgd?a=olejYD5djN&tid=wbsite">gamifying our ICO</a>. If you're interested in getting WRLD, but don't want to buy a bunch of WRLD outright, you can play our simple faucet game, which allows for rapid distribution of the token. Meanwhile, our burner game is a competition based game that awards the person who gives up the most WRLD with a TRX prize! Additional mini-games are in development. These mini-games will likely spawn their own virtual arcade project.</p>
	      <p>Each game requires separate registration, since they are built piece-wise, but the core registration will become useful as the project reaches maturity. The registration button on the home page gives 1,000 WRLD, and just requires some energy.</p>
