    	<p>World Builder is associated with a number of child and sister projects. Helping World Builder will help these other projects as well.

    	<h1>Acadadium</h1>
    	As the name implies, Arcadium is a crypto based virtual arcade. It'll be a whole ecosystem of arcade like games, filled with works by different creators. The game token with be a TRC-20 token, and will be used to play the games as well as rewards for winning games. Content creators will generally get paid in ARC tokens, unless their specific project incorporates other tokens. The first game that's being developed under the Arcadium umbrella is a visual novel, which is also being paired with a brand new visual novel game engine.
    	<h1>a href = "https://www.publish0x.com/politicoid/project-outpost-cooperative-item-exchange-xkdqpk?a=olejYD5djN">Project Outpost</a></h1>
    	The World Builder community is really excited about this project. It's probably the most ambitious out of any of the projects under the World Builder umbrella. Project Outpost will be a non-profit cooperative for trading of goods. The goal is to have brick and mortar locations around the country, if not beyond. Aside from being able to convert crypto and government issues currencies, Project Outpost will offer consignment sales, pawn loans, and more. While cosignment and pawn loans generally yield little money, because of the profit taking of pawn shops and because of the high risk involved, the non-profit cooperative nature of Project Outpost will allow that risk to be subsidised, allowing indiviuals to maximize their returns.
    	<h1><a href = "http://guildassociation.org/">The Guild Association</a></h1>
    	This project isn't under the World Builder unbrella, but it shares a similar mission to World Builder. The Guild Association's goal is to create a support system for independent contractors, freelancers, and other tradespeople. The hope is to provide not only financial and advertising support, but also education and other services that are crucial for improving the lives of workers and moving the economy from an employer-employee relationship to a person-person relationship. Among other points, The Guild Association hopes to largely <a href = "https://medium.com/politicoid/guilds-vs-for-profit-gig-companies-b368dd70da4b?source=friends_link&sk=db0b2dc8bc7a26d8d4b06582ae50a4d7">replace for profit companies like Uber et al. with non-profit cooperatives (guilds)</a.
