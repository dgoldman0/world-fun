		<p>Buildings should be very interactive. They should almost be characters themselves. But there are also the inhabitants that are created through the inter-game bridges. I think the best option would be to have a sims like enironment. The inhabitants would live and work in these buildings. They would pay rent, and it is that rent that generates the income for the buildings. Therefore a player would need to keep the buildings in good condition, and fully rented in order to generate the maximum rent possible.</p>
		<p>However, because these mini-games have become a primary method of generating demand for WRLD, I want to keep part of that element alive. So the investigators, which will instead of being every inhabitant, will become one specific group of inhabitants, will go out and search for items that serve various functions, including clues for puzzle games. The puzzle game element of the mini-games should be a major focus of the final world. In fact, the mini-game aspect can be spun off into a virtual arcade with its own token (Arcadium).</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Jigsaw puzzle game</li>
			<li>Sequence guessing game</li>
			<li>Actual 2D arcade game, perhaps the first Penguinism game.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Rather than keeping everything under WRLD, World Builder will create numerous spinoff projects, most with their own tokens that can initially be obtained by cashing in WRLD.</p>

		A major goal of World Builder is to improve crypto UI and UX, so it would be great to start a peer reviewed journal that focuses on the topic. It would be even better if we can leverage crypto to generate revenue for the authors of the articles.
