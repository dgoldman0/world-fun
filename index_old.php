      <p class = "lead">Welcome to the future home of the World Builder game. Our white paper is available, but it's in draft form. It should be completed shortly. In the meantime, if you want to support this project, you can join us in <a href = "https://t.me/tworldbuilder">our Telegram group</a>, or use our affiliate links listed below.</p>
      <p><b>Core Mission</b>: While there will be a number of projects, our core objective is to promote greater feedom and prosperity, around the world (and maybe beyond?), through blockchain and cryptoasset technologies.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Our TRC-10 token is also now live, and is available for purchase through <a href = "https://tronscan.org/#/token/1002567">TronScan</a>. The sale will continue through the end of the year.
      <p>However, we're <a href = "https://www.publish0x.com/the-bcu-times/gamifying-icos-moving-beyond-traditional-icos-improve-health-xppvgd?a=olejYD5djN&tid=wbsite">gamifying our ICO</a>. If you're interested in getting WRLD, but don't want to buy a bunch of WRLD outright, you can play our simple <a href = "https://worldbuilder.fun/faucet.php">faucet game</a>. The game has been tested and should be working properly, but it's a public beta, so there is the possibility of an unnoticed bug, so please use at your own risk. The game will soon be expanded to include a competition to burn WRLD in return for a chance to win TRX. Over the next few months, we're building a series of additional mini-games that will be fun to play and will help distribute and build a use-case for WRLD.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We recommend using <a href = "https://brave.com/wor213">Brave web browser</a>. Brave rewards users for viewing ads, makes it easy to tip website content creators, and has security and privacy in mind, with local storage of user information, and Tor built in.</li>
        <li>Prefer to avoid government monopolized fiat but want the ease of access that comes with a debit card? Try <a href = "https://getblockcard.com/i/6uYHlCrU">Ternio's Blockcard</a>.</li>
        <li>We don't necessarily think of other dapps as competition. In fact, we're a huge fan of games like <a href = "https://blockchaincuties.com?inviter=67313675">Blockchain Cuties</a> and <a href = "https://splinterlands.io?ref=kirroyale">Splinterlands</a>, and believe that <a href = "https://www.publish0x.com/geekers-keeps/power-blockchain-based-games-lies-third-party-support-xzwxpn?a=olejYD5djN&tid=worldbuilder">the power of blockchain based gaming is in third party support</a>.</li>
